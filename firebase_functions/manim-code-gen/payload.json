  "script": "In Algebra, we use letters to represent numbers. An equation is a mathematical statement with an equal sign. To solve an equation, aim to isolate the variable by performing the same operation to both sides. For example, in 2x + 5 = 11, subtract 5 from both sides to get 2x = 6, then divide by 2 to find x equals 3. When dealing with inequalities, the same rules apply, but be mindful of switching the inequality sign if you multiply or divide by a negative number. Now, let's practice with a few examples. Solve for x: 3x - 7 = 8. Got it? Great! Now here's your quiz."
